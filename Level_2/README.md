# Level 2 – Machine Learning Modeling

This folder contains **Level 2 tasks** completed as part of the  
**Codveda Data Science Internship**.

##  Objective
The objective of Level 2 is to apply machine learning techniques on real-world
datasets, build baseline models, evaluate their performance, and interpret
results using appropriate metrics.

##  Projects in This Level
- **Housing Price Prediction**
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Train–test split and model training
  - Model evaluation using regression metrics

- **Iris Classification**
  - Feature analysis and visualization
  - Target encoding
  - Baseline classification modeling
  - Performance evaluation

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Techniques Applied
- Data preprocessing and validation
- Feature–target separation
- Train–test split
- Regression and classification models
- Model evaluation (RMSE, R², accuracy, etc.)

##  Outcome
- Built end-to-end machine learning workflows
- Gained practical experience in model evaluation and interpretation
- Established strong foundations for advanced machine learning techniques

This level demonstrates the transition from **data exploration** to
**predictive modeling**.
