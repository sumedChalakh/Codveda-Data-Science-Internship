# Level 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains the **Level 1 tasks** completed as part of the  
**Codveda Data Science Internship**.

##  Objective
To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the **Iris dataset**
in order to understand data distribution, feature relationships, and patterns.
