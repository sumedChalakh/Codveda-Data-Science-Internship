# Level 3 – Advanced Data Science Projects

##  Overview
This folder contains **advanced-level data science projects** completed during the Codveda Data Science Internship.  
The focus of Level 3 is on applying data science techniques to **real-world problem domains**, including **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Time Series Forecasting**.

These projects demonstrate the ability to handle unstructured data, sequential data, and model evaluation beyond basic machine learning tasks.

### 2. Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

**Objective:**  
Analyze time-dependent data and forecast future values using statistical time series models.

**Key Steps:**
- Time series visualization
- Trend, seasonality, and residual decomposition
- Baseline forecasting using moving average
- Forecasting using ARIMA model
- Performance evaluation using RMSE

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Working with time-indexed data
- Identifying patterns in sequential data
- Building and evaluating forecasting models

**Notebook:**  
`time_series_forecasting.ipynb`
