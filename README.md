# Codveda Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains my work completed during the **Codveda Data Science Internship**.

The focus of this internship is to build real-world data science and machine
learning skills through structured tasks including data cleaning, exploratory
data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and prediction modeling.

##  Repository Structure

- **Level_1:** Data cleaning and EDA tasks  
- **Level_2:** Machine Learning modeling projects  
- **Level_3:** Advanced tasks (to be completed)

##  Highlights

- Completed Iris dataset EDA and cleaning  
- Completed first modeling task (Regression & Classification applicable)  
- Structured notebooks with outputs rendered

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
