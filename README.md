# Codveda Data Science Internship Projects

##  Internship Overview
This repository contains the projects completed during my **Data Science Internship at Codveda Technologies**.  
The internship focused on building a strong foundation in data science by applying concepts through **hands-on, structured tasks** covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

The work emphasizes **end-to-end problem-solving**, proper evaluation, and clear communication of insights.
